# COSC 6440 HW1: Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Description
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing different reinforcement learning algorithms, including TD(0), SARSA, Q-Learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN). These algorithms will be applied to the `CartPole-v1` environment from Gymnasium to evaluate their performance in terms of stability, convergence, and overall reward optimization.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repo (if applicable)
git clone https://github.com/atindra305/cosc6440-hw1-as5120.git
cd cosc6440-hw1-as5120

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Jupyter Notebook server
jupyter notebook

# Open COSC_6440_HW1_as5120.ipynb and run all cells
